# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` (the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body).
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.

## Tickets index

Also maintain a generated index at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/tickets.md`: one row per
ticket (number, title, one-line summary, Status, Blocked by), each linking to its issue
file. Refresh it only when tickets are published to this tracker, when `/triage` changes
a Status, or once per merge in `/implement-spec` (never from an implementer subagent).

The manifest is an entry point, never the source of truth. Skills read it to find which
issue files exist, then read the files themselves. If it and an issue file's `Status:`
line disagree, the issue file wins; refresh the manifest. `/wayfinder` does not use it.

```markdown
# Tickets: <feature-slug>

Generated index — resolves to the issue files below. Source of truth is `issues/`; refresh on publish, on a /triage Status change, or once after each merge in /implement-spec.

| # | Title | Summary | Status | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [01](issues/01-slug.md) | Ticket title | One-line summary | ready-for-human | None |
| [02](issues/02-slug.md) | Ticket title | One-line summary | ready-for-agent | 01 |
```
